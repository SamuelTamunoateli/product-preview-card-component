## Overview

The challenge is to replicate the product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

## What I learned

I learnt how you can change attributes of elements using javascript

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
function myFunction(){
      document.getElementById('desc').style.fontSize = '13px';
    }
```
